# UnnLinker

UnnLinker is a lightweight ELF object file parser and linker for 64-bit x86 systems. It is designed to parse object files generated by the Unnameable compiler and provide symbol extraction and section analysis.

## Features

- Parse 64-bit ELF relocatable object files (`.o`).
- Inspect section headers and names.
- Generate a basic vector of symbols for linking purposes.
- Designed to integrate with Unnameable compiler projects.

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).

## Note
-It is still highly experimental and under heavy development
